# TicTacAI 🎯
**"Where humans and algorithms play for glory."**

A Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with **multiple AI strategies** and **three game modes**:  
- **Player vs Player** 🤝  
- **Player vs AI** 🤖  
- **AI vs AI** ⚔️  

This project showcases the application of **search algorithms** and **game theory** in a simple yet engaging game.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Four AI Strategies**:
  1. Random Move
  2. Heuristic (center > corners > others)
  3. Minimax Algorithm
  4. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- Dynamic CLI board display with numbered available positions.
- Automatic win/draw detection.
- Easy-to-run in **Jupyter Notebook** or **terminal**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Random module** (for variability in AI)
- **Search algorithms**: Minimax, MCTS
- **Game theory concepts**
